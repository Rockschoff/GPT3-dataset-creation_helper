ENABLING EXCELLENCE IN PROJECT DELIVERY
SMART 
Project Control
A system built to deliver complex projects faster. Works within and across enterprises.
It works even better on multiple projects with shared resources. The greater the complexity, the more valuable and indispensable it becomes.
FINISH PROJECTS 
 20%-40% FASTER
20 \xe2\x80\x93 40%
Our customers get to the finish line 20-40% faster. More projects per year, less chaos, greater savings.
BOTTOM LINE 
 IMPACT
$6.5B
Over 400 companies around the world have generated more than $6.5B in additional cash and profits.

The Power of 
SMART Algorithms
Everyone has real-time data. Yet, projects are still late.
But SMART algorithms can now leverage that data. That\xe2\x80\x99s how SMART Project Control (and Google Maps) get you there faster. With real-time data linked to forward-looking routing algorithms.

Why our 
System Works
SMART
 PROJECT CONTROL IS ENABLED BY TWO KEY INNOVATIONS
1
The SMART Maps
streamlines 
project plans,
 and transforms them into a 
live instrument.
 No more bulky, complicated plans.
SMART 
 MODEL
SMART 
 SCHEDULING
2
SMART SCHEDULING
keeps teams working on the right tasks, and executives solving the right problems. To achieve uniterrupted execution. Even amidst always changing conditions.
Scroll
Why traditional systems don\xe2\x80\x99t work
In traditional systems, thousands of tasks are interwoven into complex plans, which are difficult and error prone.
Schedules are wrong; non-critical tasks often get priority over critical ones. Manual adjustments to course correct are onerous. Making the plans even more complex.
Then, new tasks emerge in execution. The order of the work keeps changing. Which makes it impossible to keep complex plans current.
To compensate, workarounds are created. Spreadsheets and back pocket plans. Dashboards and slides. None of which can be linked or easily reconciled.
It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise status and schedules are never reliable. And projects are always late.
SMART PROJECT CONTROL
The SMART Project Map is a leap forward
It differentiates planning from execution
PLANNING TIER
This is a delivery roadmap with supertasks. It captures managerial decisions about resource allocation, risk reduction, staging of materials, etc. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple and rarely changes.
EXECUTION TIER
This captures detailed activities inside each supertask. It\xe2\x80\x99s flexible and can be updated on the fly by the frontline, or automatically from Engineering and ERP systems.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe flow of information between the two tiers is automated.
Plans stay relevant in execution.
 Teams are synchronized and managers get early warning signals.\xe2\x80\x9d
SMART Scheduling provides reliable answers to big, tough questions
Will the project finish on time? If not, what should we focus on?
Which upcoming bottlenecks should we worry about?
Which routine delays are hurting us the most?
Which tasks should get resources next?
On multiple projects with shared resources, when can we safely start the next project?
Get the answers you need and change forever the way you think about projects.
SMART Project Control software is world-changing. It works in tandem with a powerful system of hard won practices. Offered at setup and available long-term.
Start delivering your projects on time.

Customer Personas
Who are the customers? What do they think? See? Feel? Do?

Good products and valuable innovation happen when you understand your customer and what matters to them.

Personas are the best way of developing better hypothesis.

Customer Personas
More in-depth look to your demographic/customer segment



Rohit’s customer persona
Name: Prithvi
Age: 19
Demographic: 1st year student

Attends a prestigious college
Owns a smartphone and loves to use it
Regularly attend classes and make notes
Has parents who are invested in him doing well

Frustration:  Even though he studies, he does not feels that he gets the grades, he deserves
		Does not know how to get better grades?





Your Turn
Create the persona for your idea 
User Narrative
User narrative is a story about one of the personas using and interacting the idea in the real world.
You can think of it as a movie script.

E.g. 
Prithvi is in a entrepreneurship class and hears about a quiz in a week. He opens up the app, add the test and can see all the study steps he will need to complete to do well in the test.
He adds those steps on his plan. Followed them….
He did well in test….


Your Turn
Write down your user narrative for your persona.

Power of user narrative: Help you to explain your product/service with a story.

Don’t include every single feature, just a simple story anyone can understand.
